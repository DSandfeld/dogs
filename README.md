# The dog breeds app

This app is for showcasing at Shape Games

It is simplistic and does not make use of libraries for networking, caching or storage of favorites but uses RxSwift for the reactive approach.

If the workspace is not fully working out of the box, then cocoapods needs to be installed.

Looking forward to the talk! :-)
